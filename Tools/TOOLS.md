# TOOLS

Where can I find tooling I've found while doing this minor?

*Most tooling is findable within the /notes/ folder with the .md files of each pwn.college lecture or other lectures.* It's also possible it's in the /ToDo/ folder if one of the teacher's have provided a link.  
Other tooling that I've found outside of these two scopes can be found below, per category.

*Please note for this entire markdown file the links can be down after some time, the name of the program and sometimes the version number will be displayed as well. Sometimes this is just a google search away, otherwise you always can use something like an internet time machine to see if the file still is on the server!*
