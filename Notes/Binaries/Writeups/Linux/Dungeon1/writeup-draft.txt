Everything is based upon the meeting I had with Daniel on the 30 november 2022 via Teams.

The two steps in this writeup are:
1. Reverse-engineering the code
2. Exploiting a vuln. with the know how from the code

Each of these two parts have one page each.

1. Reverse-engineering the code.

Steps, draft:
1. Took a look at the program: requires input from a field, then calls the ping command.
2. Ran in trough objdump with the -x parameter, found main, vault and gate.
3. Used dbg to dissas main, vault and gate. Found some intersting stuff
	- system call
	- intersting c calls
4. Ran it trough gidhra to check said findings.

2. Exploting a vuln.
1. Went trough a list of known CWEs. Found a CWE that matched code in Gihra.
2. Found out that the input field can pass 2 commands to the shell
3. Iserted 127.0.0.1 ; cat flag.txt
4. Got the flag back within the scope of the program.

Done
