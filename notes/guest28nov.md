Name: Joerie Zomer  
Working in Google  
Research Consulency Etc.  
Code reviews, static code analysis, fuzzing, CTF team member.

Give advice: make CTFs to introduce you to the world of cybersecurity. Can also be very close to real world. CTFs become more realistic, so good to learn.

Recommends Weggli for static code analysis (Ghidra>code>Weggli, can work with decompiled output).  
Joern also recommended.
